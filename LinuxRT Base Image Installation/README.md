# NI Replication and Deployment Utility

The NI Replication and Deployment (RAD) reference utility provides a turn-key solution for automated NI Real-Time device image deployment, replication, and management. It is built using functionality provided by the NI System Configuration API. The utility provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and deploying images from NI Real-Time targets. To learn more about configuration management with NI Real-Time devices, visit the RAD Utility White Paper. To discussion issues with RAD, visit the LabVIEW Real-Time Application Deployment Discussion Forum.
